Blockchain-based ledger system
---

A decentralized blockchain based ledger system was created for Banks to conduct trustless transcations with. A bank would indicate where the funds came from, where they should be sent, and how much should be transfered. Once these details have been committed to the block, the transaction executes and the record is stored. 

The system, Pychain, comes complete with an easy to navigate UI powered by Streamlit.
